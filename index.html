        Hi there!  I am Varshini.  I am a rising senior 
        in high school.  Welcome to my personal website!  
        Here you can check out some of my code projects.  I       started coding when I was 14 years old and began          compiling all of my projects onto this website. 
        Apart from that I enjoy drawing and have been 
        doing it since I was little.  You can check out
        my spotlight gallery here too.  Other 
        than that, I enjoy experimenting with my 
        keyboard, riding my bike, watching tv, 
        and reading.
      </p>
